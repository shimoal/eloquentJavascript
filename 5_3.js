//Historical life expectancy

//When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than 90 years, only the latest generation in the data came out. Letâ€™s take a closer look at that phenomenon.

//Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry data set per century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their year of death, dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as in Math.ceil(person.died / 100).

  function plus(a, b) { return a + b; }
  return array.reduce(plus) / array.length;
}

var centuries = {}

	var century = Math.ceil(person.died / 100);
	if (!centuries[century])
